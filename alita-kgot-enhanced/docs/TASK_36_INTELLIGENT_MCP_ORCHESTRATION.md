# Task 36: Intelligent MCP Orchestration

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **Intelligent MCP Orchestration** system, a framework designed to manage and execute complex, multi-step AI tasks. This system is inspired by the controller concepts from the **KGoT (Knowledge Graph of Thoughts)** paper and the manager agent from **Alita**, providing a mechanism to orchestrate workflows of Modular Cognitive Processes (MCPs).

The implementation for Task 36 delivers a core orchestration engine that can dynamically compose an execution plan, manage dependencies between steps, and execute independent tasks in parallel to improve efficiency.

## 2. Key Features

The implemented orchestration system includes the following core features:

-   **Task Decomposition**: Leverages an externally-supplied `SequentialThinking` MCP to break down a high-level task prompt into a series of smaller, manageable subtasks.
-   **Dynamic Execution Graph**: Automatically generates a dependency graph from the list of subtasks. This graph defines the execution order and identifies which MCPs can be run concurrently.
-   **Parallel Execution with Dependency Management**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` library to execute independent MCPs in parallel. A dependency resolution mechanism ensures that an MCP only begins execution after all of its prerequisite tasks are complete.
-   **Workflow Optimization (Placeholder)**: Includes a placeholder for a resource optimization step. This demonstrates where cost-benefit analysis from a performance analytics module can be integrated to select the most efficient MCPs for a task.
-   **Data Flow Management**: An `MCPChain` class manages the state and results of the workflow, allowing the output of one MCP to be used as input for subsequent MCPs.
-   **MCP Registry**: A dictionary mapping MCP identifiers (e.g. `mcp_analyze`) to fully-featured MCP instances supplied by the application.

## 3. Architecture

The system's architecture is centered around the `IntelligentMCCOrchestrator` class, which manages the entire workflow lifecycle.

### Workflow Breakdown

1.  **Decompose Task**: The orchestrator receives a task prompt and uses the `SequentialThinking` module to generate a list of subtasks. This plan can include sequential and parallel steps.
2.  **Generate Execution Graph**: The list of subtasks is transformed into a formal execution graph, where nodes represent MCPs and edges represent dependencies.
3.  **Optimize Workflow (Placeholder)**: The orchestrator consults the `MCPPerformanceAnalytics` module to get cost and latency estimates for the planned workflow. Currently, this step prints the analysis but does not alter the execution plan.
4.  **Execute Workflow**: The orchestrator executes the graph. It iterates through the nodes, running tasks whose dependencies are met. `asyncio.gather` is used to run all parallelizable tasks concurrently.

## 4. Core Classes and Data Structures

The system is built around a few key classes:

-   `IntelligentMCCOrchestrator`: The main class that orchestrates the entire process, from task decomposition to final execution.
-   `MCPChain`: A simple class to store and retrieve the results of executed MCPs, managing the data flow within the workflow.
-   **Execution Graph**: A dictionary representing the workflow, containing a list of `nodes` (MCPs to run) and `edges` (dependencies between them).

## 5. Usage Example

Below is a minimal example that shows how **production code** can supply real components via dependency injection.  Replace the `…MCP()` classes with your concrete implementations:

```python
import asyncio

from orchestration.intelligent_mcp_orchestration import IntelligentMCCOrchestrator

# Concrete MCP implementations – replace with real ones
from my_project.mcps import AnalyzeMCP, SearchHistoricalMCP, SearchVisitorMCP, SynthesizeMCP
from my_project.sequential_thinking import SequentialThinkingMCP
from my_project.performance import PerformanceAnalytics

# Build a registry that the orchestrator can look up
mcp_registry = {
    "mcp_analyze": AnalyzeMCP(),
    "mcp_search_historical": SearchHistoricalMCP(),
    "mcp_search_visitor": SearchVisitorMCP(),
    "mcp_synthesize": SynthesizeMCP(),
}

# Instantiate orchestrator with real dependencies
orchestrator = IntelligentMCCOrchestrator(
    sequential_thinking_mcp=SequentialThinkingMCP(),
    mcp_performance_analytics=PerformanceAnalytics(),
    mcp_registry=mcp_registry,
)

async def run():
    result = await orchestrator.execute_task("Tell me about the Eiffel Tower.")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run())
```

## 6. Logging and Configuration

-   **Logging**: The orchestrator now uses Python's built-in `logging` package for structured, leveled output.  Hook this into your central Winston/ELK pipeline or adjust the handler as needed.
-   **Configuration**: All dependencies (`SequentialThinkingMCP`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, and an MCP registry) are injected at construction time, keeping the orchestrator framework-agnostic and easy to test.

## 7. Conclusion

The Intelligent MCP Orchestration system provides a solid foundation for managing complex AI workflows within the Alita-KGoT Enhanced system. It successfully demonstrates dynamic workflow generation from a task prompt, dependency management, and parallel execution of independent tasks. While key components like sequential thinking and resource optimization are currently placeholders, the framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for these features to be fully integrated in the future.
