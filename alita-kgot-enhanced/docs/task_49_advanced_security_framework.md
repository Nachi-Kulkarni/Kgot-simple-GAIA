# Advanced Security Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Advanced Security Framework for the Alita-KGoT Enhanced System implements a comprehensive security architecture based on principles from the KGoT and Alita papers. This framework provides enterprise-grade security features including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), secure execution environments, threat detection, and secure communication protocols.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AdvancedSecurityFramework** - Main orchestrator that coordinates all security components
2. **RBACManager** - Implements fine-grained Role-Based Access Control
3. **SecureExecutionEnvironment** - Enhanced containerized execution with monitoring
4. **ThreatDetectionEngine** - Real-time threat detection and response
5. **CommunicationSecurityManager** - TLS 1.3 enforcement and certificate management
6. **SecurityPolicyEngine** - Centralized policy management and compliance checking

### Security Principles

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: MCPs have no access by default; permissions must be explicitly granted
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Zero Trust**: All operations are verified and monitored
- **Ephemeral Execution**: Single-use containers that are destroyed after execution
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

## Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Security Levels
- `PUBLIC` - Publicly accessible resources
- `INTERNAL` - Internal system resources
- `CONFIDENTIAL` - Sensitive business data
- `RESTRICTED` - High-security operations
- `TOP_SECRET` - Maximum security classification

#### Default Roles
- **read_only**: Read access to public resources only
- **code_executor**: Execute code in sandboxed environments
- **system_admin**: Full system access (restricted use)

#### MCP Profile Configuration
```python
profile = MCPProfile(
    mcp_id="my_mcp",
    roles=["code_executor"],
    allowed_resources={"files": ["/sandbox"]},
    network_access=False,
    max_execution_time=60,
    max_memory="256m",
    max_cpu=0.5,
    security_level=SecurityLevel.INTERNAL
)
```

### 2. Secure Execution Environment

#### Enhanced Containerization
Builds upon KGoT's containerized Python Executor with additional security features:

- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time constraints
- **Network Isolation**: Disabled by default, requires explicit permission
- **Filesystem Restrictions**: Read-only containers with limited tmpfs
- **Capability Dropping**: Minimal Linux capabilities (CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE only)
- **Security Options**: `no-new-privileges`, custom seccomp profiles

#### Container Security Configuration
```python
container_config = {
    "security_opt": ["no-new-privileges:true"],
    "cap_drop": ["ALL"],
    "cap_add": ["CHOWN", "DAC_OVERRIDE"],
    "read_only": True,
    "tmpfs": {"/tmp": "noexec,nosuid,size=100m"}
}
```

### 3. Threat Detection and Response

#### Detection Methods
- **Falco Integration**: Runtime security monitoring for containers
- **Pattern Matching**: Custom rules for suspicious behavior detection
- **Log Analysis**: Real-time analysis of container logs

#### Threat Levels
- `LOW` - Informational events
- `MEDIUM` - Suspicious activity requiring attention
- `HIGH` - Security violations requiring immediate action
- `CRITICAL` - Severe threats requiring emergency response

#### Automated Response
- **Container Termination**: Immediate killing of compromised containers
- **Security Alerts**: Notifications to administrators
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable security event records

#### Detection Rules
```python
detection_rules = {
    "suspicious_network": {
        "pattern": r"connect\(.*\)",
        "severity": ThreatLevel.MEDIUM,
        "description": "Unexpected network connection attempt"
    },
    "privilege_escalation": {
        "pattern": r"(sudo|su|chmod\s+777)",
        "severity": ThreatLevel.CRITICAL,
        "description": "Privilege escalation attempt"
    }
}
```

### 4. Secure Communication

#### TLS 1.3 Enforcement
- **Minimum Version**: TLS 1.3 only
- **Strong Ciphers**: AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Certificate Verification**: Mandatory hostname and certificate validation
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange

#### Certificate Management
- **Automatic Generation**: Self-signed certificates for development
- **CA Integration**: Support for enterprise certificate authorities
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automated certificate lifecycle management

### 5. Security Policy Engine

#### Policy Categories
- **Execution Policies**: Resource limits and execution constraints
- **Data Access Policies**: File system access controls
- **Communication Policies**: Network and protocol restrictions
- **Compliance Policies**: Audit and retention requirements

#### Compliance Checking
```python
compliance = policy_engine.check_compliance("execute_code", {
    "timeout": 120,
    "network_access": True
})
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```python
from security.advanced_security import AdvancedSecurityFramework

# Initialize the framework
security_framework = AdvancedSecurityFramework()

# Register an MCP
security_framework.register_mcp(
    mcp_id="data_processor",
    roles=["code_executor"],
    allowed_resources={"files": ["/sandbox/data"]},
    network_access=False,
    max_execution_time=300
)
```

### Secure Code Execution
```python
# Execute code with full security framework
result = await security_framework.execute_secure_operation(
    mcp_id="data_processor",
    operation="execute_code",
    parameters={
        "code": "import pandas as pd; print('Processing data...')",
        "timeout": 60
    }
)
```

### Custom RBAC Configuration
```python
# Define custom role
custom_role = Role(
    name="data_analyst",
    permissions=[
        Permission("file", "/data/*", {"read"}),
        Permission("api", "analytics", {"query"})
    ],
    security_level=SecurityLevel.CONFIDENTIAL
)

# Register role
security_framework.rbac_manager.roles["data_analyst"] = custom_role
```

### Threat Monitoring
```python
# Start monitoring a container
security_framework.threat_detector.start_container_monitoring(container_id)

# Check for threats
threats = security_framework.threat_detector.threat_events
for threat in threats:
    if threat.threat_level == ThreatLevel.CRITICAL:
        print(f"Critical threat detected: {threat.description}")
```

## Configuration

    "min_tls_version": "1.3",
    "allowed_protocols": ["https", "wss"]
  }
}
```

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
All security operations are logged in JSON format for SIEM integration:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "mcp_id": "data_processor",
  "operation": "execute_code",
  "result_status": "success",
  "security_framework": "advanced"
}
```

### Threat Events
Security threats are recorded with full context:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid-here",
  "timestamp": 1642248600.0,
  "threat_level": "high",
  "source": "container:abc123",
  "description": "File access outside sandbox",
  "affected_resources": ["container:abc123"]
}
```

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Active Threats**: Number of ongoing security incidents
- **Registered MCPs**: Count of MCPs with security profiles
- **Policy Violations**: Compliance violation statistics
- **Container Executions**: Secure execution metrics
