    """
    Weighted scoring for method selection:
    - Accuracy Weight: 0.4 (40%)
    - Cost Weight: 0.3 (30%) 
    - Runtime Weight: 0.3 (30%)
    """
    normalized_cost = 1.0 - (cost / 100)
    normalized_runtime = 1.0 - (runtime / 100)
    
    return (accuracy * weights.accuracy + 
            normalized_cost * weights.cost + 
            normalized_runtime * weights.runtime)

    """Bridge for MCP tool generation based on extracted knowledge"""
    
    async def generate_tools_from_knowledge(self, knowledge_patterns):
        """
        Process:
        1. Analyze knowledge patterns for tool opportunities
        2. Generate MCP tool specifications
        3. Create dynamic tool implementations
