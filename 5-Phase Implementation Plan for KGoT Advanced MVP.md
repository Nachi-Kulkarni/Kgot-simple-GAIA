## **Success Metrics by Phase**

**Phase 1:** Solid knowledge-first foundation with 100% core component test coverage
**Phase 2:** 10-15% improvement in GAIA Level 3 scores over baseline through knowledge graph construction
**Phase 3:** 15-20% improvement through multi-modal capabilities and specialized reasoning
**Phase 4:** Target 18% improvement with 25% cost reduction achieved
**Phase 5:** Production-ready system with comprehensive validation and deployment capability

## **Implementation Principle**

Every component, every function, every architectural decision must be made with this question:

**"Does this convert unstructured information into structured knowledge representation that enables smaller models to outperform state-of-the-art on complex reasoning tasks while reducing costs?"**

This system transforms AI reasoning from expensive brute force to cost-effective intelligence through structured knowledge representation.

**Every implementation step advances this transformation.**
